# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Good living together

To maintain an open and inviting environment, we, contributors and maintainers, seek to make our contribution environment respectful to all, regardless of age, ethnicity, nationality, personal appearance, religion, gender identity and expression.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behaviors are:

* Use inviting and inclusive language
* Be respectful of different points of view and experiences
* Good acceptance of constructive criticism
Focus on what is best for the community
* Show empathy with other contributors

Examples of negative and unacceptable behaviors:

* Use of sexualized language, either through texts or images
* Posting offensive comments with personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publish personal information of third parties without prior authorization
* Any other conduct that may be considered negative for the project or its stakeholders

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for making acceptance standards clear. In addition, they are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instance of unacceptable compliance.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, edits in documentation, issues, and any other contributions that are not in line with this Code of Conduct, or temporarily or permanently ban any contributor whose behavior is inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to any space in which an individual is representing the project or its community. The definition of the project representation is subject to the maintainers.

## How to report

Instances of threats, abuse or any other unacceptable behavior should be reported to project maintainers whose contacts are available in the documentation. The maintainer will review all complaints and will respond in any way that is deemed most appropriate. The maintainer contacted is obliged to maintain confidentiality regarding the identity of the complainant.

Project maintainers who do not follow or apply this Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions in accordance with the judgment of other maintainers.
